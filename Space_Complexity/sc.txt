What is Space Complexity?
The term space complexity generally refers to the memory space that a code uses while being executed. Again space complexity is 
also dependent on the machine and so we are going to represent the space complexity using the Big O notation instead of using the 
standard units of memory like MB, GB, etc.

Definition:
Space complexity generally represents the summation of auxiliary space and the input space. Auxiliary space refers to the space 
that we use additionally to solve a problem. And input space refers to the space that we use to store the inputs.
