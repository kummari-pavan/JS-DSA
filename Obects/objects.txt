Objects:
--------
Objects are used to store key-value pairs. They provide a way to structure data and group related values together, such as the 
 of an entity.

Advantages:
----------

Flexible and dynamic for storing any data type.
Makes data more descriptive with key-value pairs.
Easy to modify, add, or remove properties.

Example:
---------
let person = {
    name: 'Pavan',
    age: 20,
    job: 'Developer'
};
console.log(person.name);  // Access property using key


Disadvantages:
-------------

1.No Indexing

2.Overhead in Memory: Storing key-value pairs increases memory overhead compared to arrays, which only store values.
3.Lack of Order:      In JavaScript, objects donâ€™t guarantee order in key-value pairs.
4.Slower Operations:  Object operations (insertion, deletion) can be slower compared to arrays due to hashing and key-value lookups.
5.Difficulty with Iteration: Iterating over an object requires special loops (like for...in), which isn't as straightforward as arrays.
6.Limited Methods:    Fewer built-in methods for manipulation compared to arrays.
