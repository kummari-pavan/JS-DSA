Arrays: Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable, enabling easy access and manipulation of data in a sequence.
        They are useful when you need to store lists of elements.
    
Advantages:
-----------

Easy access to elements by index.
Supports many built-in methods for manipulationlike push(), pop(), shift(), unshift(), etc
Dynamic sizing in JavaScript we can add or remove elements easily.

Example:

let Top_comp = ['apple', 'google', 'Microsoft'];
Top_comp.push('Microsoft');  // Adds 'Microsoft' at the end
console.log(Top_comp);

Disadvantages:
--------------

Fixed Indexing: Accessing elements by index is fast, but inserting/removing elements at the beginning or middle can be slow 
                due to re-indexing.
Memory Consumption: In JavaScript, arrays are dynamic, but they can consume more memory compared to some other data structures.

Homogeneous Assumption: Though arrays in JavaScript can store multiple types, many languages assume arrays to be of a single type.

Inefficient Searching: Searching for an element (especially in an unsorted array) requires scanning the entire array, which can be
                       slow for large datasets.
No Key-Value Pair Support: Arrays lack the ability to map values to specific keys, which makes storing related data tricky 
                           compared to objects.
