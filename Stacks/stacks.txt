Stacks:
------
Why we use: A stack follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle. It is used in scenarios where we need to reverse elements or go back to a previous state, like undo operations in editors.

Advantages:

Useful in backtracking algorithms (e.g., maze solving, undo operations).
Efficient for managing function calls (recursion).
Simple to implement using arrays.

Example:

let stack = [];
stack.push(10);  // Add elements
stack.push(20);
console.log(stack.pop());  // Remove and return the last element (20)
