1.Binary Search Tree (BST) has the following key properties:
---------------------------------------------------------
Left Subtree Rule: The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
Right Subtree Rule: The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
Recursively Applies: Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees (i.e., they must follow the same properties).
No Duplicate Values: A BST typically does not allow duplicate values for simplicity in operations
