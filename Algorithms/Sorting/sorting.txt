1. Bubble Sort
--------------
Bubble Sort compares adjacent elements and swaps them if they're in the wrong order. It keeps doing this until the entire array is sorted.

Steps:
Start at the beginning of the array.
Compare the first two elements. If the first is larger, swap them.
Move to the next pair and repeat.
After one pass, the largest element "bubbles" to the end.
Repeat until the array is sorted.
